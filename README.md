Optimization of runtime and libraries, workflow deployment, resource management, and data management

### Objectives
    • Optimize the eFlows4HPC machine learning and workflow runtimes to obtain the required levels of performance and energy efficiency. 
    • Enable a stable deployment platform, supporting the selected container solution for dynamic deployment of the HPC Workflow-as-a-Service concept. 
    • Provide a stable set of innovative storage solutions to support scientific workflows. 
    • Identify relevant data sources, list them in a Data Catalogue and into an Integrated Data Logistics Service. 
    • Implement Data Pipelines to fuel Pillars use cases. 
The implementations performed in the tasks of this WP will be integrated with the results of task 1.4 and into its deliverables.
